# Miniature Greenbus System
The project includes a map with 4 cities and 16 locations within them. There are two options in the bus system:
1)   Booking a Trip: The user enters the start location and end location and the algorithm calculates how to travel there with the minimum cost possible using Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
2)   Booking a Tour: The user has to enter the start and end locations with an additional option to select other locations in between the route. The algorithm calculates the minimum path and minimum cost of travel for the user.
 
The user interface gives options for both user and admin signups, offering a wide range of functionalities for both.
